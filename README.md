# Cuisine Restaurant Layout

#100Dev gave us a challenge to complete the above layout with HTML and CSS. I use flexbox to create the layout while pulling free pictures from Adobe Stock. The images do not match exactly, but are close. I use background-image for the first two areas. Instead of 'button' tag I just use 'a' tags for the links.

There is no carousal where the video image is, but I have an image with the play icon. This is done because I am not using javaScript to complete the layout. We are just getting use to CSS and making manageable layouts.
